Great job, Abby!

   Details:
   Line 91: Nice using a function not covered in class!
   Line 96-101: Nice checking against these boundary conditions
   Line 143: This is valid, but better just use if total_words: or if bool(total_words)
   Line 155: Good job using this function that we learned earlier this semester!
   Line 160: re.split not covered in class
   Line 204: This will match words with only one digit
   Line 330-343: '.'.capitalize() return itself. So this is not necessary, even
                 though faster
   Line 404-406: Nice handling capitalized case as well
   Line 451-456: Use specific group for each parts
   Line 460-467: Use date_str, hour_str, minute, second you have Extracted
