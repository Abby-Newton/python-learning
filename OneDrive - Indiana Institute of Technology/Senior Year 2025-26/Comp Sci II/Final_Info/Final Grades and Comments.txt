Comments:
    Problem 1: 
    1. search needs to be case insensitive
    2. Line 27: Use while not for statement for 
                n needs an initial ValueError
    3. Line 28: Wrong way to test if line contains word

    Problem 2:
    1. Line 44 and Line 54: Don't change the value of initial_balance
        __init__ will always set initial balance to 0, 
                no matter what parameter is provided
    2. Line 71-76:
        self.balance will never be changed

    3. Line 94-99:
        self.balance will never be changed

    4. Line 102-111:
        Line 110: don't do this!    
    Problem 3:
    1. Assume operation is character:
        compare operation to character: should surround + with quotes
    2. Line 152-162:
        Wrong way of capturing error message
    3. Return is wrong

    Problem 4:
    1. Python indexing of an array s[0], brackets and paratheses
    2. s != str: wrong way to test if s is a string
    3. No recursion step

    Problem 5:
    1. students is a list of tuples, the second element of each tuple is a list of grades
       so these is no s['grades']
    2. Line 258--wrong way of constructing lambda function
    3. Line 258-- surrounding list function with bracket, will create a list of one element
    4. Line 269-- students does not have a key average
